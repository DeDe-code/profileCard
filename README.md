## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The hardest part of this challenge was to found the solution to positioning the two svg files on the background. 
The other hardest part was to disapeared the little space between the profile img and it's border. 
I didn't find solution for this problem. 
Even yet there a very thiny gap. 
If you have any idea pleas tell me.


In the next projects i would like to deep into more complex css layouts like grid, flexbox... e.t.
